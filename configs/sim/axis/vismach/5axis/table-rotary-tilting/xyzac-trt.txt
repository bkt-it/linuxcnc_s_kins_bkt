xyzac-trt-kins (switchkins)

Uses remapped user m codes for kins switch:

  M429: Identity Kinematics
  M428: XYZAC (TCP)
  M430: userk Kinematics

A hal net is required to connect the
analog out pin N, Example (for N=3):

  net :kinstype-select <= motion.analog-out-03
  net :kinstype-select => motion.switchkins-type


Hal Input pins:
  xyzac-trt-kins.x-offset
  xyzac-trt-kins.z-offset

X and Z offsets are the offsets from the center
of rotation of the C axis relative to the center
of rotation of the A axis.

Hal Input pins:
  xyzac-trt-kins.x-rot-point
  xyzac-trt-kins.y-rot-point
  xyzac-trt-kins.z-rot-point

X, Y and Z rot-point pins represent are the
offsets of the center of rotation of the A axis
relative to the machine absolute zero
coordinates.

The hexapod (Stewart platform) configuration is a set of files that makes up a very basic LinuxCNC hexapod.

Start the machine, toggle E-Stop and Machine power, press Home all button and enter world mode. Note that Z home is 20, to run axis.ngc you need to touch off Z to 0.


hexapod.ini
---------------
Config file for a general hexapod.
To get it working with your machine you need to adjust base and platform joints coordinates in kinematics.hal and specify [KINS]KINEMATICS=genhexkins.
If you change the HOME location in TRAJ, make sure you change the appropiate HOME locations of the AXES as well, and make sure the position match (when run through the kinematics).

NOTE: The line "HALCMD = net ..." establishes a hal connection to enable switching kinematics betwen genhexkins, identity, and a user-defined kinematics


LIB:basic_sim.tcl
--------------
Defines simulated joints, no real hardware attached in this config.

kinematics.hal
--------------
Defines base and platform joints coordinates.

hexagui.hal
--------------
Adds simple Vismach visualisation for hexapod.

hexapod.xml
---------
Adds PyVCP panel.

hexapod_postgui.hal
------------------
Adds joints values and iterations number to PyVCP panel.
